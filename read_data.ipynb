      "Claim: 3 reasons why Gwyneth Paltrow should be admired\n",
      "Reference: doc_588\n",
      "Perspective: She isn’t afraid to try new things.\n",
      "Document: After Paltrow won an Oscar in 1999, she was at the top of her game and could’ve scored any movie role she wanted. However, she didn’t rest on her laurels. Instead, she forged new paths: Some of them have been more professional, like country singing, producing cookbooks, and starting her own business , which is worth $250 million , while others have been more personal, like volunteering to fundraise for non-profits, promoting macrobiotic diets and detoxes, and speaking out against sexual harrassment in general and against internet trolls at tech conferences. Despite getting mocked for some of her choices, she keeps getting involved in new things. In 2017, she became an advisor for Bitcoin start-up Abra and today is an executive producer for her Goop lab documentary series on Netflix. Expanding one’s horizons, as she constantly does, is something a lot of us tell ourselves and our children to do.\n",
      "Reference: doc_568\n",
      "Perspective: She stayed dignified and resilient in the face of hardship.\n",
      "Document: In 2014, Paltrow divorced her husband, Chris Martin, after over 10 years of marriage. Unlike many high-profile celebrity splits, Paltrow and Martin were determined to keep their divorce amicable. She may have gotten a lot of flak for using the term “ conscious uncoupling ” to describe their divorce, but the fact that she and Martin have succeeded in peacefully co-parenting their two children after their divorce is something to admire. As is her ability to redefine today’s modern family , by keeping things friendly between her ex husband and her current husband. Paltrow also showed the resilience by being one of the first actresses to come forward about having been sexually harassed by Harvey Weinstein . In so doing, she helped start a global conversation about sexual harassment in the workplace.\n",
      "Reference: doc_772\n",
      "Perspective: She bucked Hollywood's pressure to never grow old.\n",
      "Document: Now almost 50, Paltrow is at the age where Hollywood usually forces female actresses to slow down and even fade away. But she hasn’t given in to the ageist and sexist pressure of the entertainment and business world. Instead, she has become even more visible by taking on more diverse roles involving singing and dancing, such as a recurring role in the TV show Glee , a star turn in the blockbuster franchise Iron Man, and a central role in the TV show The Politician . People looking for feminist actresses to buck Hollywood’s pressure to never grow old should look up to Paltrow for blazing a path. What’s more, she has also public spoken against gender pay inequality in Hollywood, further showing she’s one to stand up to Hollywood’s pressures.\n",

      "Perspective: Her lifestyle company promotes unrealistic and out-of-touch ideals.\n",
      "Document: When Goop launched in 2008, it was immediately attacked for its meaningless name. Ever since, it has been ripped apart even more for being pretentious and offering what many perceive as unrealistic health, parenting and lifestyle products and advice. Goop’s products are considered too expensive and lavish even for the average well-off reader. When was the last time someone needed a $20K vibrator? No one minds that Paltrow is capitalizing on her fame. After all, Jessica Alba and Reese Witherspoon, among other celebrities, also have brands that sell a wide range of lifestyle products. However, the latter seem to know their target markets. Maybe if Paltrow wouldn’t claim that fashion is too expensive while trying to peddle a $1200 coat, her company wouldn’t seem so out of touch.\n",
      "Reference: doc_1019\n",
      "Perspective: She promotes health fads that can be dangerous.\n",
      "Document: Over the years, Paltrow has embraced a lot of quirky health fads and recommendations. She was heavily in favor of a macrobiotic diet, came out loudly as a raw foodist, and took a very long time to accept eating chicken. Likewise, Goop has marketed pseudo-scientific products and services like jade eggs, vaginal steaming and stickers that supposedly rebalance your energies. Some of the health trends that Paltrow has promoted are not backed by science and have turned out to be potentially damaging . The size of Paltrow’s following turns her endorsement of possibly harmful products into something potentially dangerous.\n",
      "Reference: doc_352\n",
      "Perspective: She can come off as patronizing.\n",
      "Document: We’re all aware that celebrities are richer than ordinary people and that they live more luxurious lives. But it does rub salt into the wound when one of them tries to be relatable to the masses. For instance, Paltrow’s past claim that “I’m incredibly close to the common woman,” comes off as condescending. After all, most common women don’t come from a privileged upbringing whose family has tens of millions of dollars of wealth. Additionally, Paltrow’s participation in the 2015 SNAP challenge against food hunger could have been inspiring, but instead she was patronizing when she bought six limes with her allotted $29-a-week budget. By doing so, Paltrow showed that she had very little in common with the common woman at all. It would be less irritating if Paltrow stopped trying to pretend that she’s like every other woman and just admitted her privileged lifestyle.\n",

      "Documents:For many parents, particularly those with more than one child, summer vacations can be a stressful and difficult time. Without the structure provided by school attendance, children become bored easily and parents struggle to cope. This is especially true for mothers who may be bringing up children without a father present, or those who wish to continue or resume their careers after the first few years of motherhood; trying to combine a full-time job with the rigours of motherhood is hard but trying to do so during a three month school holiday is almost impossible. Year-round schooling makes such a work-life balance easier for young parents and allows women to return to the workplace on their own terms. \n",
      "Documents:If the school hours are extended, adults wouldn't have to pay for after-school care for as long as they would now. Also, they would be able to work longer hours thus getting more money, and making life more of a luxury. For instance, lets say that you finish school at 3pm. Your parents might put you in after-school care from 3pm-5pm, until they can pick you up. After-school care, in my case, is $50 per hour. Are parents willing to pay this price? If we extend school hours to 5pm, they won't have to put you in after-school care saving about $500 per week. Also, adults could work for longer and pick you up at about quarter-past 5-5:30, as you are allowed to stay after school is over for an amount of time. If we make school longer, this will save money, get adults more and make your life more luxurious. \n",

I believe that their should also be plethora of time time given to the child for his physical development. If much of homework is put on him\\er there's less time for him\\er to go out and play outdoor games. If the child after school is also busy with his homework, he finds less time for discovering himself , his capabilities and hobbies. Therefore I would like to end and say anything in excess is bad, everything should be balanced out in life for a better living. \n",
      "Documents:If more work was done in a structured environment built for working in, where you can get help with your work and you can work more intensively without distractions, you don't have to do as much homework. Then your home life is something separate from your study life, so you can concentrate on playing and family time. \n",
      "Documents:They are also more likely to have to work after school and on weekends, or look after younger siblings, leaving less time for homework. A study by the Hispanic Heritage Foundation found that 96.5% of students across the country said they needed to use the internet for class assignments outside of school, and nearly half reported there had been times they were unable to complete their homework due to lack of access to the internet or a computer, sometimes resulting in lower grades. Private tutoring is a more than $6 billion enterprise that further advantages students from wealthier families. A study published in the International Journal of Education and Social Science concluded that homework increases social inequality because it \"potentially serves as a mechanism to further advantage those students who already experience some privilege in the school system while further disadvantaging those who may already be in a marginalized position.\" \n",
